In this lab, we will learn how to process raw data to prepare it for training and evaluating a model.\n","\n","## Overview\n","\n","Building a dataset for an AI model is extremely important. A good dataset will help the model accurately identify and perform effectively. Because we want the vehicle to best recognize traffic signals in the map, we prioritize collecting data ourselves rather than using publicly available sources. After obtaining the original images, we will sequentially process them to clean and enrich the data. The final step is to label them and divide them into training, validation, and test files according to a customized ratio.\n","\n","## Learning Objectives\n","After completing this exercise, learners will have acquired the following knowledge:\n","  - Image preprocessing\n","  - Some data augmentation methods\n","\n","## Related Knowledge\n","  - Python\n","  - Image processing\n","  - OpenCV\n","\n","## Prerequisites\n","To complete this exercise, you will need the following knowledge:\n","  - Basic programming skills in Python\n","  - Basic understanding of functions in the OpenCV library\n","\n","## Problem\n","**Objective**: Data processing and augmentation\n","\n","**Requirements**\n","- Input: Raw data\n","- Output: Data processed and ready for model training.\n","\n","## Instructions\n","\n","Below is a detailed guide to help you understand the data processing workflow.\n","\n","### Installing Required Libraries\n","To perform operations and organize files in the system, we need to use the `os` library.

By training the model with images that match the input camera, you can improve the accuracy and performance of the object detection system, thereby enhancing the safety and effectiveness of the autonomous vehicle.\n","\n","Therefore, to achieve the best results, training images should be collected and processed similarly to how the input camera will capture them in real-world scenarios.\n","\n","When collecting images, they are often large in size and not proportionate to the camera's aspect ratio.\n","\n","Thus, a step is needed to resize the images to match the aspect ratio of the ESP32 camera's input image at 320x240.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"rUiv692b_00N","outputId":"63fe6c4e-6931-44c9-f186-e41ceb5f197f"},"outputs":[],"source":["# image's path\n","img = cv2.imread([...])\n","original_height, original_width = img.shape[:2]\n","print(f\"Original size: {original_width}x{original_height}\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"bZaKFMX3_00O"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Display image\n","cv2.imshow(\"test\", img)\n","cv2.waitKey(0)\n","cv2.destroyAllWindows()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IMeV4c2G_00O"},"source":["#### Practice\n","**Exercise 1:** Complete the following code by filling in the [...].\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"KefqPaDO_00O"},"outputs":[],"source":["def resize_image(image, target_width=320, target_height=240):\n","    # Get image size\n","    original_height, original_width = image.shape[:2]\n","\n","    ### Your code starts here ###\n","    # Calculate the ratio\n","    target_ratio = [...]\n","    original_ratio = [...]\n","\n","    if original_ratio > target_ratio:\n","        [...]\n","    else:\n","        [...]\n","\n","    # Resize the photo to fit the target size\n","    resized_img = cv2.resize([...])\n","    ### Your code ends here ###\n","\n","    return resized_img\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"pkC55fUD_00O"},"outputs":[],"source":["resized_image = resize_image(img, 320, 240)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"IleA26Sg_00O"},"source":["#### Result"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"0I4qw4aw_00O"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Display resized image\n","cv2.imshow(\"test\", resized_image)\n","cv2.waitKey(0)\n","cv2.destroyAllWindows()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"kApqH9cG_00O"},"source":["### Data Augmentation\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hwmP6Bmu_00O"},"source":["#### Theory\n","**Data augmentation** is the process of creating variations of existing data by applying transformations such as rotation, translation, brightness adjustment, etc., ensuring the data covers a wide range of situations.
